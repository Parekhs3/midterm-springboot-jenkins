# Midterm Spring Boot Jenkins Project

This is my midterm project where I set up a Spring Boot application and connected it to Jenkins for automated builds using a GitHub webhook.  
The goal was to understand how continuous integration (CI) works â€” from pushing code on GitHub to having Jenkins automatically build and test it.


## Steps Completed:
- Created Spring Boot project using Maven
- Set up Jenkins container on Docker
- Installed necessary plugins and configured pipeline
- Connected GitHub repository to Jenkins via webhook
- Automated build and deploy stages

## Technologies Used:
- Java
- Spring Boot
- Maven
- Jenkins
- Docker

## Trigger Test
Each time a commit is pushed to GitHub, Jenkins automatically builds and tests the project.
